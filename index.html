        <h2 class="section-title">Research Statement</h2>
        <p class="research-intro" style="text-align: justify;">
            I am a qualitative researcher working at the intersection of Human Computer Interaction, Science and Technology Studies, and Craft Studies. I thrive in sites where I can observe and understand how new computational processes reconfigure work - particularly work that is collaborative, embodied and sensorially-informed. I explore how human sensing, tacit knowledge, and computational systems intermingle in situated practice, curiousities that often center on the evolution of craft-based work. My process as a researcher is ethnographic. I practice carefully listening to participants, gently observing their day-to-day, asking questions that test my understanding, and attuning myself with the sensorial experiences of others. Through this, I aim to assist with the development of more responsive, heterogenous, compassionate, and functional technological systems.
        </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Projects</h2>
    <p class="projects-intro" style="text-align: justify;">
     The projects below represent key investigations that inform my understanding of the sensory and embodied aspects of human-machine collaboration, as well as how social worlds give shape to our interpretations, enactments, and understandings of new technological futures. When taken together, they reveal how sensorial and tacit knowledge is never only individually held, but socially distributed, technologically mediated, and emergent through practice.

                            <p>And, how does it react and respond to new computational processes and sensing technologies? This project examines the violin as a boundary object that traverses artistic and scientific domains, exploring how traditional craft knowledge intersects with digital measurement and modeling tools. Through ethnographic observations and interviews with luthiers, acousticians, and performers, I investigate how the materiality of instruments, embodied practices of musicians, and computational analysis co-constitute a shared sonic world. This research illuminates broader questions about how traditional knowledge practices adapt to, resist, and transform technological innovation while maintaining their essential character.</p>

                            <p>Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in two teaching hospitals using the da Vinci surgical robot, we examine how robotic mediation transforms the sensory environment of surgery and necessitates new collaborative practices. Our research reveals how surgical teams develop sophisticated compensatory techniques and sensory articulations to overcome the limitations of technologically mediated perception. These adaptations create a distributed, more-than-human sensorium that extends beyond individual bodies to encompass the entire surgical team and technological system. This work contributes to both medical device design and broader HCI theory by demonstrating how sensory-aware design approaches can better support the embodied, collaborative nature of technologically augmented professional work. <a href="images/sensing-coop.pdf" class="paper-link" target="_blank">Read Paper</a></p>

                            <h3>How Do Digital Tools Transform Craft and Design Practices in Fine Art Furniture Making?</h3>
                            <p> Through studio visits and interviews with renowned fine art furniture maker Wendell Castle and his team, we investigate the complex integration of digital fabrication technologies into established craft practice. Our research reveals how this hybrid environment creates new forms of creative expression, reshapes material relationships, and transforms collaborative workflows. Rather than diminishing craft knowledge, we find that digital tools become entangled with embodied expertise, creating distinctive socio-technical arrangements where digital and physical processes mutually inform each other. This case study provides insights into how traditional knowledge practices evolve through technological mediation, offering a nuanced perspective on human-technology partnerships that extends beyond simple narratives of replacement or enhancement. <a href="images/digital-entanglements.pdf" class="paper-link" target="_blank">Read Paper</a></p>

                            <h3>How Can Urban Permaculture Help us Develop and Document Plant-People Relations?</h3>
                            <p>This passion project explores the transformation of a small urban backyard into an experimental permaculture system while building understandings of ecological relationships through direct engagement with living systems. The garden itself becomes both a research site and a material argument for coming to understand our own plant-people relations. This on-going project led to the collaborative creation of a community zine meant to probe how others answer similar questions. The project culminated in a conference talk examining participatory approaches to more-than-human narratives and a book chapter on co-creating narratives and knowledge through creative, non-institutional practice. This work extends my broader research on sensing and embodied knowledge into ecological contexts while exploring collaborative methods for documenting lived experience.<a href="https://issuu.com/igrimmfreelance/docs/maybethemustarddigital" class="paper-link">Read Zine</a>
