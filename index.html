                <p>I am a qualitative researcher working at the intersection of <em>Human Computer Interaction</em>, <em>Science and Technology Studies</em>, and <em>Craft Studies</em>. I explore how human sensing and computational systems mutually transform established ways of knowing and making by exploring the situated practices of work and collaboration. My process is to carefully listen to informants, to gently observe their day-to-day, to ask questions to test my understanding, and to align myself as best I can with their sensorial experiences. I look for sites where I can turn to the social, distributed, and emergent nature of sensing and study how new computational actants intermingle with embodied forms of work. This enables me to share insights into diverse sensory experiences and help to develop more responsive, compassionate, and functional technological systems.</p>

                    <p>Drawing from literature in HCI, craft studies and Science and Technology Studies (STS), we explore craft's modern formation at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution across three formative sites: Scandinavian Slöyd, British Arts and Crafts, and Japanese Mingei. From this review we identify three key (and still evolving) features: craft's accountabilities to natural materials and local ecologies; craft's holistic ways of making with 'head, heart, and hand'; and craft's distinctly collaborative and embodied styles of teaching and learning.</p>

                    <p>Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in two different teaching hospitals that deployed the da Vinci surgical robot, this paper traces how the introduction of robotics reconfigures the sensory environment of surgery and how surgeons and their teams recalibrate their work in response. We illustrate how sensory (re)articulations and compensations allow the surgeon and surgical teams to adapt to a more-than-human sensorium and conclude by advocating new forms of sensory-aware design capable of enhancing and supporting embodied sensory conditions both individually and across teams.</p>

                    <p>Drawing on studio visits and interviews with fine art furniture maker Wendell Castle and his team, we investigate one studio's experience with integrating digital fabrication tools into their studio practice, and its implications for the collective organization of work and creativity. We chart new forms of creative practice and material flow that emerge from this encounter, and show how remediations of craft in the Castle studio may pose questions and opportunities for wider CSCW concerns around craft, creativity, and design.</p>
